# KSMG-Maillog-Analyzer
This script was written for e-mail traffic logger from Kaspersky Mail Gateway. Just for work to automate weekly routine.

In my case I had task to analyze traffic of in/out messages because we don't receive major numbers of letters from our international contractors 
for one reason - blacklist.
This script helps me for searching log records directly, without 'one-by-one' logic
